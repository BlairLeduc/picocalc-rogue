# Create patches

Create a `working` directory and copy the original source files that need to be modified into it. Then, make your changes in the `working` directory.

If you add new files that will need to be patched, add that file to the `create_patches.sh` script.

Finally, run the `create_patches.sh` script to generate the `patches/rogue.patch` file.
